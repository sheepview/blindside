#summary Notes on setting up the dev environment, but not on the VM

Not for beginners. This is a rough set of guidelines on how to set up the bbb dev environment on Unix system. These notes are complimentary to the notes on [DevelopingBBB Developing BigBlueButton]

We recommend installing on Ubuntu 10.04 32-bit system. You'll need to have a BigBlueButton VM running to copy some of the files.

  # Make sure you have git installed by running `sudo apt-get install git-core`.
  # [http://code.google.com/p/bigbluebutton/wiki/InstallationUbuntu Install BigBlueButton from packages].
  # Copy the /home/firstuser/dev/tools directory off the VM and copy it to the dev machine ~/dev/tools. If you don't have a VM handy, you can grab the files from the Downloads page:
    # wget http://bigbluebutton.googlecode.com/files/grails-1.1.1.tar
    # wget http://bigbluebutton.googlecode.com/files/gradle-0.8.tar
    # wget http://bigbluebutton.googlecode.com/files/flex3.tar
    # Put these tars in ~/dev/tools and untar them there. These were grabbed off a VM and they should be configured as good to go.
  # Copy the ~/.profile script from the VM to ~/.profile. Then do 'source .profile'. You may need to change 'firstuser' in the script. Again, if you don't have a VM, see [DevEnvironmentVariables this page] for the environment variables you need to export.
  # Install openjdk-6-jdk: sudo apt-get install openjdk-6-jdk . You could do another java but I know everything works well with openjdk and the paths will be easier to midify.
  # Do bbb-conf --setup-samba anyway, the script has some side-effects
  # Do bbb-conf --setup-dev client
  # Try building the client with 'ant'
  # If client build fails, find flexTasks.jar in ~/dev/tools/flex dir and copy it to where ant says it expects it
  # Edit /etc/nginx/sites-available/bigbluebutton. Change the client to load from where you have it instead of /home/firstuser. Restart nginx.
  # Do bbb-conf --setup-dev apps
  # Go to the bbb-apps source (~/dev/source/bbb/bbb-apps/). Edit build.gradle and change any instances of 'firstuser' to whatever your user name is.
  # Build and deploy apps as normal (gradle war deploy). Then restart red5. make sure it starts with no errors.
  # Do bbb-conf --setup-dev web.
  # Go to bbb source, edit bigbluebutton-web/grails-app/conf/bigbluebutton.properties. Change the salt there to your salt and the ip of the server to your server/domain. This is so you don't have to run bbb-conf --setip and --setsalt after you deploy.
  # Instead of the usual instructions to run bbb-web, go to bbb-web source and do 'grails war'. This should create bigbluebutton.war if you're lucky ;) . Copy it to /var/lib/tomcat6/webapps/bigbluebutton.war.
  # Restart tomcat (/etc/init.d/tomcat6 restart). Make sure it starts fine with no errors in /var/lib/tomcat6/logs/catalina.out
  # The instructions for bbb-common-message should be straight forward, but you most likely won't need to set up the dev env for this. Just use bbb-common-message.jar in bbb-web.
  # I have not gone over the instructions for bbb-voice yet as I haven't needed it. if you want to fill in this part let me know the instructions and I'll put them in.
