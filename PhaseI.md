Introduction

The aim of this Phase-I is to analyze and re-factor the existing code of Blindside Project. In this Phase, different plug-in architectures will be reviewed and investigated.  Finally, an initial Plug-in architecture will be selected based on its viability and feasibility in order to pursue the Blindside project.

Details
> - Analyze the existing code and the control flow of the application.

> - Re-factor the viewer and move the code related to clients presence to other     applications of the project such as white board.

> - Investigate various Plug-in Architectures and define an initial Plug-in architecture for our project.

> - Analyze the creation of application

> - Re-factor the creation and distribute it in a way that other applications such as chat, white board etc can also run explicitly.

> - Analyze the coupling tools such as DUPLOC and other open source tools and select one of them most viable for our project.

> - Define and narrow the area of research

> - Investigate Re-Engineering Tools for existing application

> - Red5 RTMP client for testing the server
